# Project Brief: FluentCMS Plugin System

## Project Vision
Create a flexible, robust plugin architecture for ASP.NET Core Web API applications that allows developers to dynamically extend core application functionality at runtime without modifying the base application.

## Core Requirements
1. **Dynamic Plugin Management**
   - Discovery, loading, and unloading of plugins at runtime
   - Enable/disable plugins without application restart
   - Support plugin lifecycle management (install, activate, deactivate, uninstall)
   - Version compatibility checking

2. **Seamless Integration**
   - Plugin DLLs hosted in the same process as the main application
   - Dependency injection support for plugin services
   - API controller integration with automatic route registration
   - Middleware pipeline integration
   - Background task support

3. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**
   - Inter-plugin communication mechanisms
   - Configuration management for plugins
   - Database integration options
   - Security boundaries and permission systems
   - Error handling and fault tolerance

## Success Criteria
- Plugins can be activated/deactivated without restarting the application
- Plugins can register their own services with proper isolation
- Plugins can define API endpoints following conventions
- Plugins can interact with each other through defined communication channels
- Plugin failures are contained and don't crash the host application
- Plugin resources are properly managed and cleaned up when deactivated

## Constraints
- Plugins must be developed as .NET assemblies
- Host and plugins must target the same .NET Framework version
- Plugins must follow defined interface contracts
- Security boundaries must be maintained to prevent malicious plugin behavior
