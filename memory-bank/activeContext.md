# Active Context: FluentCMS Plugin System

## Current Focus
- Testing and validating the complete plugin system
- Enhancing error handling and fault tolerance
- Developing real-world plugins for validation
- Implementing plugin configuration management

## Recent Changes
- Added integration infrastructure for plugins:
  - MVC controller integration with PluginControllerFeatureProvider and PluginControllerRouteConvention
  - Middleware integration with PluginApplicationBuilder
  - Background task management with PluginBackgroundTaskManager
- Created comprehensive sample plugin demonstrating all integration points
- Updated extension methods for registering all plugin system components
- Implemented endpoint routing for plugins

## Next Steps
1. Create comprehensive integration tests
2. Implement proper error handling and fault tolerance
3. Add plugin configuration management
4. Create system for plugin dependencies
5. Enhance security and validation for plugins
6. Develop documentation and usage examples

## Active Decisions

### Assembly Loading Approach
- Using `AssemblyLoadContext` with `isCollectible: true` for proper unloading
- Plugin assemblies will be loaded in isolated contexts
- Dependencies will be resolved through `AssemblyDependencyResolver`

### Plugin Service Registration
- Plugins will register services through `IPluginStartup.ConfigureServices`
- Service lifetimes will respect DI container's standard patterns
- Service isolation will use named registrations where appropriate

### API Integration Strategy
- Plugins will define controllers in a designated namespace
- Routes will be automatically prefixed with plugin identifier
- Standard RESTful conventions will be followed
- API versioning will be supported

### Plugin Communication Pattern
- Using event-based communication through `IPluginEventBus`
- Events as POCOs that can be serialized/deserialized
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous subscribers
- Error handling in message processing to prevent cascade failures

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Favor composition over inheritance in plugin design
- Use dependency injection consistently throughout the system
- Follow async/await patterns for I/O-bound operations
- Use cancellation tokens for long-running operations
- Implement proper resource disposal for loaded plugins

## Implementation Insights
- Plugin isolation is challenging but critical for system stability
- Assembly loading contexts must be managed carefully to prevent memory leaks
- Database access from plugins needs special consideration for connection management
- Exception handling across plugin boundaries requires careful design
