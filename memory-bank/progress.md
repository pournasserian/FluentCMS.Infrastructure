# Progress Tracking: FluentCMS Plugin System

## Current Status
- **Project Phase**: Foundation Implementation
- **Status**: Core interfaces implemented, working on service implementations
- **Memory Bank**: Updated to reflect current progress

## Completed Work
- Initial project vision and requirements documented
- High-level architecture defined
- Solution structure created with 5 projects (Core, Plugins, Storage, Host, Tests)
- Core contracts implemented (IPlugin, IPluginStartup, IPluginInstaller, IBackgroundTaskProvider)
- Plugin metadata model and database context implemented
- Plugin communication system (PluginEventBus) implemented with tests
- Interfaces defined for plugin discovery, loading, and registry
- Host registration extension methods created

## In Progress
- Implementing concrete services (PluginDiscoveryService, PluginRegistry, PluginLoader)
- Setting up database migrations for plugin metadata
- Planning a sample plugin implementation for validation

## Next Milestones
1. **Foundation Implementation** (Next)
   - Core interfaces implementation
   - Basic plugin discovery and loading
   - Plugin metadata storage

2. **Core Services Development**
   - Plugin registry implementation
   - Dynamic assembly loading/unloading
   - Service registration for plugins

3. **Integration Features**
   - API controller integration
   - Middleware pipeline integration
   - Background service support

4. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**
   - Plugin communication system
   - Configuration management
   - Error handling and fault tolerance

5. **Administration Features**
   - Plugin management API
   - Plugin health monitoring
   - Installation/activation interfaces

## Known Issues and Challenges
- Proper assembly unloading to prevent memory leaks
- Plugin isolation to prevent cascade failures
- Service lifetime management across plugin boundaries
- Security boundaries for plugin execution

## Project Evolution
- Initial concept focused primarily on API extension
- Current design expanded to include comprehensive plugin system
- Future enhancements could include plugin marketplace and UI management
- Security considerations have been elevated in priority

## Technical Debt
- None at this early stage, but tracking will begin as implementation starts

## Next Actions
1. Implement PluginDiscoveryService for scanning and registering plugins
2. Implement PluginRegistry for tracking plugin state
3. Implement PluginLoader for loading and initializing plugin assemblies
4. Create database migrations for plugin metadata
5. Develop a sample plugin to validate the infrastructure
6. Add a simple management API for controlling plugins
