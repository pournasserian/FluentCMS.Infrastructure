# Progress Tracking: FluentCMS Plugin System

## Current Status
- **Project Phase**: Integration Features
- **Status**: Integration implementations complete, ready for system testing
- **Memory Bank**: Updated to reflect current progress

## Completed Work
- Initial project vision and requirements documented
- High-level architecture defined
- Solution structure created with 5 projects (Core, Plugins, Storage, Host, Tests)
- Core contracts implemented (IPlugin, IPluginStartup, IPluginInstaller, IBackgroundTaskProvider)
- Plugin metadata model and database context implemented
- Plugin communication system (PluginEventBus) implemented with tests
- Concrete service implementations completed:
  - PluginDiscoveryService for scanning and registering plugins
  - PluginRegistry for tracking plugin state
  - PluginLoader for loading and unloading plugin assemblies
- Database migration for plugin metadata created
- Plugin configuration options added
- Integration infrastructure implemented:
  - MVC controller integration with route conventions
  - Middleware integration through plugin-specific builders
  - Background task management with lifecycle handling
- Sample plugin demonstrating all integration points created
- Host application for testing implemented

## In Progress
- Testing plugin system with complex scenarios
- Developing error handling strategies
- Planning additional features for plugins
- Exploring plugin configuration and dependencies

## Next Milestones
1. **Foundation Implementation** (✓ Completed)
   - Core interfaces implementation ✓
   - Basic plugin discovery and loading ✓
   - Plugin metadata storage ✓

2. **Core Services Development** (✓ Completed)
   - Plugin registry implementation ✓
   - Dynamic assembly loading/unloading ✓
   - Service registration for plugins ✓

3. **Integration Features** (✓ Completed)
   - API controller integration ✓
   - Middleware pipeline integration ✓
   - Background service support ✓

4. **Cross-Cutting Concerns** (Current)
   - Plugin communication system ✓
   - Configuration management ✓
   - Error handling and fault tolerance

5. **Administration Features** (Next)
   - Plugin management API
   - Plugin health monitoring
   - Installation/activation interfaces

## Known Issues and Challenges
- Proper assembly unloading to prevent memory leaks - Addressed with AssemblyLoadContext
- Plugin isolation to prevent cascade failures - Implemented with error handling in EventBus
- Service lifetime management across plugin boundaries - Handled via DI container
- Security boundaries for plugin execution - Needs additional implementation

## Project Evolution
- Initial concept focused primarily on API extension
- Current design expanded to include comprehensive plugin system
- Future enhancements could include plugin marketplace and UI management
- Security considerations have been elevated in priority
- Emphasis on testability with sample host application

## Technical Debt
- Some error handling in the PluginLoader that could be improved
- The sample plugin has a few compiler warnings that should be addressed
- Need comprehensive integration testing for the plugin system

## Next Actions
1. Improve error handling and fault tolerance mechanisms
2. Develop comprehensive integration tests
3. Add plugin configuration management
4. Implement plugin dependency system
5. Add plugin health monitoring capabilities
6. Create documentation and usage examples
