# Progress Tracking: FluentCMS Plugin System

## Current Status
- **Project Phase**: Initial Planning
- **Status**: Architecture and design phase
- **Memory Bank**: Initialized with core documentation

## Completed Work
- Initial project vision and requirements documented
- High-level architecture defined
- Core interfaces and contracts outlined
- Design patterns and system components identified

## In Progress
- Setting up project structure and solution organization
- Defining detailed interface contracts for plugins
- Planning implementation approach for core components

## Next Milestones
1. **Foundation Implementation** (Next)
   - Core interfaces implementation
   - Basic plugin discovery and loading
   - Plugin metadata storage

2. **Core Services Development**
   - Plugin registry implementation
   - Dynamic assembly loading/unloading
   - Service registration for plugins

3. **Integration Features**
   - API controller integration
   - Middleware pipeline integration
   - Background service support

4. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**
   - Plugin communication system
   - Configuration management
   - Error handling and fault tolerance

5. **Administration Features**
   - Plugin management API
   - Plugin health monitoring
   - Installation/activation interfaces

## Known Issues and Challenges
- Proper assembly unloading to prevent memory leaks
- Plugin isolation to prevent cascade failures
- Service lifetime management across plugin boundaries
- Security boundaries for plugin execution

## Project Evolution
- Initial concept focused primarily on API extension
- Current design expanded to include comprehensive plugin system
- Future enhancements could include plugin marketplace and UI management
- Security considerations have been elevated in priority

## Technical Debt
- None at this early stage, but tracking will begin as implementation starts

## Next Actions
1. Create solution structure with core projects
2. Define and implement base interfaces
3. Create plugin discovery service
4. Implement assembly loading strategy
5. Set up database schema for plugin metadata
